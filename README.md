# Landlord Rating application
a full-stack web application for rating landlords

### MVP

1. A CRUD app with models of users, reviews, address, landlords, management companies
2. Search by addresses, landlords, companies
3. See a landlord or company's aggregate rating (e.g. a landlord gets a rating of 3/5 out of the average of 10 user reviews)

Note: the individual review should include a rough date of when one lived there.
